 * This EventsNormalizer has two main objectives:
 * 1. Change all maeslstrom `applybuff`, `applybuffstack`, and `refreshbuff` events into a single `resourcechange`
 * event that captures all resource gains from an individual source, such as the two maelstrom stacks when
 * Ice Strike is cast when talented into Elemental Assault and Swirling Maelstrom, or the variable no. of stacks from
 * Static Accumulation (anywhere from 1-10).
 * 2. Find `removebuff` and `removebuffstack` events that relate to cast events for maestrom weapon eligible spells, and
 * set populate the `classResource` and `resourceCost` fields with the number of stacks consumed.
 *
 * The reason we do this is to simplify later analysis by enabling analyzers to look at cast events without needing
 * to also do calculations on Related events (from an EventLinkNormalizer).
